# Hi, I'm Nuha üëãüèæ üßïüèΩ

<div style="background-color: #fec89a; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
  I'm a recent graduate from the University of Texas at Dallas, with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. I chose to make the career pivot into software engineering for 3 reasons:

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Flexibility and Versatility</strong></summary>
  Software engineering offers professionals the opportunity to work in various industries, including technology, finance, healthcare, and more. This versatility provides the chance to work on diverse projects and explore different domains. As a software engineer, I look forward to leveraging my skills to tackle challenging problems and make a meaningful impact in various fields.

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Integration of Hardware and Software</strong></summary>
  With the rise of embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the boundaries between hardware and software are becoming increasingly blurred. As an electrical engineer with software engineering skills, I am excited about contributing to the design, development, and integration of hardware and software systems. This combination allows for a holistic approach to problem-solving and enables me to leverage my knowledge in both domains.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Passion for Open Source and Community Building</strong></summary>
  During my time at UTD, I had the opportunity to explore software development and discovered my passion for making open-source contributions, creating technology to elevate people, and building a strong community. I am eager to continue honing my software engineering skills, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and driving positive change through technology.

  <h3 align="left"> üöß Current Project:</h3>

   I‚Äôm currently working on **Tech Elevator**, a full-stack web development bootcamp. After its bootcamp, I will join the **Software Engineer Program (SEP)** at JP Morgan Chase & Co!

  <summary><strong>Module 1: Intro to Programming</strong></summary>

  - **Java** and **C#** both continue to be among the most popular, in-demand programming languages in the world. You can use them to build applications for the web, mobile devices, Internet of Things, and much more. You're likely familiar with several applications that are written using Java (like Google tools, Netflix, and Uber) or C# (like the Microsoft suite, apps like Keepass, and games created with Unity).
  - **Git** is a version control system (VCS). You can use it to track the changes that you and your teammates make to a shared set of code.
  - **IDEs** (integrated development environments) are applications that serve as dedicated ecosystems for writing code. They include many development tools, such as coding suggestions, testing capabilities, debuggers for troubleshooting, and much more‚Äîall in one application.

  <summary><strong>Module 2: Client-Server Programming</strong></summary>

  - **Spring** and **Microsoft .NET** are among the most widely used frameworks for the Java and C# languages, respectively. Each has a vast community of users and maintains quality documentation.
  - **PostgreSQL** and **SQL Server** are relational databases, which are highly organized. They allow you to create data structures that are easy to maintain and adaptable to changing needs.
  - **SQL** is a language used to pull and edit data in relational databases.
  - **REST** is a modern API architecture used to facilitate communication between multiple computers or programs. You use it to send information back and forth between your code and a server through the internet.

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Module 3: Web Application Development</strong></summary>

  - **HTML** is the language of web structure. It enables you to build web pages and determine how to display the elements.
  - **CSS** is the language of web styling. You can use it to create compelling layouts for all kinds of devices.
  - **JavaScript** has been a gold standard in web development for decades. It controls how the web pages behave, like dynamic design and user interaction.
  - **Vue.js** is steadily increasing in popularity as a JavaScript framework. It provides the power and capability of many front-end frameworks and doesn't require a steep learning curve.
  - **Chrome Developer Tools** are a set of browser-based tools used for webpage diagnostics.
